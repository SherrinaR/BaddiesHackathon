# BaddiesHackathonTechnical Documentation:
Tools and Technologies: 
    Framework: Visual Studio Code 
    Programming languages: Python, CSS, Javascript, HTML. 
    Technology: OpenAI API
Methodology: We used a scrum moethod for this project because it allowed us to build the platform quicker for the hackathon.
Architecture: Utilizing Visual Studio Code the Open AI key was imported. The next component was prompting the user to input the type of bot they would like to interact with, using a message input. The last component is a while loop that prompts the user to input their question and retain their response history. 
Challenges and Bugs: The technical challenge was intergrating the backend and the frontend to work seemlessly. We would need more time to troubleshoot this issue. 
Testing: We tested each component separately. As we work we test after each update to the code so that bugs are fixed along the way. 
Deployment: Explain how you deployed the project, whether it's on a specific platform, cloud service, or self-hosted, and any deployment automation or scripts used.
